### **MIPS Processor Implementation in VHDL**  

This project develops a **MIPS processor** in **VHDL**, featuring **5 stages** to enhance instruction execution efficiency:  

- **IF (Instruction Fetch)** – Retrieves instructions from memory.  
- **ID (Instruction Decode)** – Decodes instructions and accesses registers.  
- **EX (Execute)** – Performs arithmetic and logical computations.  
- **MEM (Memory Access)** – Handles data memory operations.  
- **WB (Write Back)** – Updates registers with execution results.
